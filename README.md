### A React Native App that Helps Those Interested In Investing Learn From Others, Theirs Successes, and Their Mistakes

### About

This app is an exploration of "machine learning", react native, redux, realm, express, Go, and AWS.
The app provides a "safe copy" of stock trading and investing. 

You can see what works well for other people, look for tips and recommendations based on your trading style, and keep track of your portfolio in real-time.

## Installation
To use the app:
1. Fork It!
2. Git clone "YOUR REPO's NAME"
3. npm install
4. To run, `react-native run-ios`

## Technologies
1. React Native: The Front End
2. Express (NodeJS) & Go(lang): The backend for receiving post requests and sending get requests.
3. Realm: a permant storage solution for holding important state.
4. Redux: The State Manager for my asychronous calls that I wish to share among different components.
5. ES2015: With Babel
